You will create a program to manage different types of bank accounts at the Bank. The aim is to use abstract classes and interfaces to define common and specific behaviors for different types of accounts.

As an additional challenge, add an enum called AccountType to represent different types of accounts, such as CURRENT and SAVINGS. Modify the Account classes to use this enum and add an overloaded method to the Bank class to perform transfers between accounts.
