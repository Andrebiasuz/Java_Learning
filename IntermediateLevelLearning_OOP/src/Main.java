        // CONSTRUCTORS

        // Refer to challenge 4 to check about constructors. They are basically molds to initialize molds,
        // or a set of parameters to instantiate objects

        // ABSTRACT CLASSES

        // we are talking much about class mother and father, etc But there is a way to make these classes "steril".
        // in this way, the Mother Class Neighbor will not have kids, but she will be used as a mold for other classes.
        // Now the tribal classes instantiate the objects, and the Neighbor class is standard of which these classes are created

        // we will create NeighborAbs to indicate that it is abstract
        // we will also make the tribal classes inherit from this abstract class
        // we can also have abstract methods, which dont have any actions in the abstract class, only in the classes
        // they are instantiated .
        //
        // For this, we have the profession() method as an example, but we wont use it since
        // it is already an example of interface use.

        // what is common between abstract classes and interfaces?
        //      They can only declare abstract objects, not arguments.
        //      They cannot instantiate objects.

        // why using abstract classes at all if they dont instantiate anything?
        //      Because in this case, we do not want to create any object from the class Neighbor. We only use it
        //      as template. And we want to force the user to create objects the right way, since here everybody
        //      will have its own tribe. So we create objects straight from the tribes, using the Neighbor template


        //   Main Concepts about Superclasses and Subclasses
        //
        //    Superclass: The generic class from which other classes inherit. It contains attributes and
        //    methods common to all subclasses. In the example above, Neighbor  is the superclass.
        //    Subclass: A class derived from a superclass. The subclass inherits attributes and methods from
        //    the superclass, but can add its own or modify (overwrite) existing ones.
        //    In the example, Sutobo  and Wanaba are subclasses of Neighbor.
        //    Inheritance: This is the mechanism that allows a subclass to inherit characteristics from a superclass.
        //    In the example, both Sutobo and Wanaba inherit Neighbor's showBasicData() method.
        //    Method overwriting: When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that
        //    is already defined in its superclass.
        //    In the example, profession() is overwritten in the Sutobo and Wanaba subclasses.

        //  Main Concepts about Interfaces
        //
        //     Concept: An interface is like a contract that contains abstract method declarations
        //    and constants. Any class that implements an interface must provide the implementation of the
        //    methods defined by it.
        //    Separation of Responsibilities: Interfaces help separate the “what to do” (defined by the interface)
        //    from the “how to do it” (implemented by the classes), promoting a cleaner and more modular design.
        //    Multiple Inheritance: In Java, a class can only inherit from a single class,
        //    but it can implement several interfaces.
        //    This allows you to create varied behaviors without the limitations of single inheritance.
        //    Flexibility and Polymorphism: Using interfaces allows different classes to implement
        //    the same contract, facilitating the use of polymorphism when working with
        //    methods that accept objects of different types.
        //    Example in the Context of Neighbors :
        //    Imagine a Neighbor interface with methods such as Welcome(), Walk() and Shout().
        //    Classes like Andre and Alexandra could implement this interface and provide specific behaviors
        //    for these methods, while the code that consumes the interface treats both objects uniformly.

        // CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOAD

        // We need to add two attributes to our neighbor, yearsAsNeighbor and NeighborRank.
        // Neighbor ranks are Casual, Reliable, Guardian, and Grand.
        // Ranks are fixed, so let's create an enum.
        // ENUM created, so we need to change the main neighbor superclass to put these values.

        // Constructor created in the super class. A constructor with the values originally created(name,age,street)
        // and another one with the values that came after.
        // This is important because, if we created objects with the OLD constructor and after decide to change that
        // Constructor, we would have to change the old code.
        // This is not scalable
        // In this way, we overload the original constructor, adding new features.
        // Now we can initialize Neighbor using both constructor. Using what is best for the moment.

        Sutobo Tomas = new Sutobo("Tomas", 30 , "Rua do Reticulo", 5, NeighborRank.GRAND);

        System.out.println();
        Tomas.showBasicData();

        // NEXT METHOD OVERLOAD, WE WILL OVERLOAD THE showBasicData()


        //     Method overloading: This is the process of defining more than one method with the same name in a class,
        //     but with different signatures. Method signatures differ by the number of parameters,
        //     the type of the parameters, or the order of the parameters.
        //    Method signature: The signature of a method includes its name and the list of parameters.
        //    Overloading requires that each overloaded method has a unique signature, which allows the
        //    compiler to distinguish between methods.
        //    Flexibility and Reuse: Method overloading allows you to reuse the method name to perform similar operations,
        //    but adapted to different types of input. For example, you could have a method for calculating damage in a fight with different types of attacks, such as a physical attack or a jutsu attack.
        //    Example in the Context of Neighbor: Imagine a shout() method that can be overloaded to accept different
        //    parameters: one that performs a standard shout and another that performs a shout based on
        //    how angry the person is. This way, you can use the same method name for different  scenarios.
        //    Limitations: Method overloading is based only on the method signature (name and parameters).
        //    The return type alone cannot be used to differentiate overloaded methods.

        // Tomas is very smart. He wants to show his IQ in Basic Data.
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Basic data with IQ showing");
        Tomas.showBasicData(190);

        // USE OF THE OVERRIDE ANNOTATION
         //
        //    Concept of @Override: The @Override annotation is used to mark a method in a subclass that is
        //    overriding a method in the superclass. This clearly indicates the intention to override an
        //    existing method in the superclass.
        //    Compilation error: Although not mandatory, using @Override helps the compiler check
        //    whether the subclass method is actually overriding a superclass method.
        //    If the superclass method is changed or removed, the compiler will generate an error if the
        //    subclass method is annotated with @Override and does not match the signature of the method
        //    in the superclass.
        //    Improved readability: The @Override annotation improves the clarity of the code by making it clear
        //    that the method is overriding a method in the superclass. This makes the code easier to understand,
        //    especially in complex class hierarchies.
        //    Convention and Practice: Although the use of @Override is not mandatory,
        //    it is a widely accepted and recommended practice that helps to avoid subtle errors and facilitates code maintenance.
        //    Example in the Context of Naruto: Imagine a Ninja class with a method shout() and subclasses such as
        //    Wanaba and Sutobo that override this method. Using @Override on subclasses helps ensure
        //    that the overridden method corresponds to the method defined in the superclass.

        // REFERENCE IN MEMORY x VALUE IN MEMORY
        System.out.println();

        System.out.println("Reference in memory");
        //System.out.println(AlexandraD); // prints Sutobo@6e2c634b , this is the space allocated in memory
        //System.out.println(AlexandraD.name); // prints value stored in the memory (name Alexandra), this is value in memory

        // what is toString method is going to do?

        //toString , as auto generated by IntellJ, will provide me documentation of attributes  tied to the class.
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Printing object with toString");
        System.out.println(AlexandraD.toString());
